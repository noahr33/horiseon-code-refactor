# Horiseon Code Refactor

In this project I refactored the code in the following ways:

* **Added a proper title description** 
* **Added the missing anchor element destination**
* **Added alt attributes for correct accessibility practices**
* **Simplified CSS code by combining selectors that share the same attributes**

***
